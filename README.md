Machine Learning A-Z üß†
This repository contains my personal work and experiments from the "Machine Learning A-Z" Udemy course.
I use this project to practice exercises, run experiments, and test my own ideas to deepen my understanding of Machine Learning and AI concepts.

üìÇ Repository Structure
The repo is organized into sections following the course structure:

Part 1 - Data Preprocessing

Part 2 - Regression

Part 3 - Classification

Part 4 - Clustering

Part 5 - Association Rule Learning

Part 6 - Reinforcement Learning

Part 7 - Natural Language Processing

Part 8 - Deep Learning

Part 9 - Dimensionality Reduction

Part 10 - Model Selection & Boosting

Each folder contains:

Exercises from the course

My experiments and test scripts

Optional notes to document insights or tricky concepts

üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies
Python (main language for exercises)

Jupyter Notebooks / PyCharm for development

Libraries:

numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn

scikit-learn, tensorflow / keras

nltk and other NLP tools (for Part 7)

üöÄ Purpose
The main goal of this repo is to:

Apply concepts from the course with hands-on coding

Experiment beyond the tutorials to improve my ML understanding

Create a personal reference for future ML projects
