# Machine Learning A-Z 🧠

This repository contains my personal work and experiments from the **"Machine Learning A-Z"** Udemy course.  
I use this project to **practice exercises, run experiments, and test my own ideas** to deepen my understanding of Machine Learning and AI concepts.

## 📂 Repository Structure

The repo is organized into sections following the course structure:

1. **Part 1 - Data Preprocessing**  
2. **Part 2 - Regression**  
3. **Part 3 - Classification**  
4. **Part 4 - Clustering**  
5. **Part 5 - Association Rule Learning**  
6. **Part 6 - Reinforcement Learning**  
7. **Part 7 - Natural Language Processing**  
8. **Part 8 - Deep Learning**  
9. **Part 9 - Dimensionality Reduction**  
10. **Part 10 - Model Selection & Boosting**  

Each folder contains:
- **Exercises** from the course  
- **My experiments and test scripts**  
- **Optional notes** to document insights or tricky concepts
